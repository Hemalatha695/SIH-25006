## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
 ## Detailed Explanation
The solution is a Smart Biosecurity Management Platform with a modern, modular design:

1. Biosecurity Rating Engine
Uses a rule-based scoring model
Evaluates farm practices such as feed storage, waste management, visitor entry, farm cleaning, livestock movement, etc.
Generates a “Biosecurity Status Card” with priority actions

2. Knowledge & Training Hub
Simple, farmer-friendly video guides
Step-by-step checklists
Animated instructions for disease prevention
Micro-learning modules that farmers can complete in short sessions

3. Compliance Calendar
Daily, weekly, and monthly tasks
Automatic reminders for cleaning, vaccination, disinfection, etc.

4. Incident & Alert System
Region-wise disease notifications
SOS reporting feature for farmers to alert vets
Weather-based disease risk indicators

5. Multi-Stakeholder Dashboard
Veterinarians can track multiple farms
Authorities can see biosecurity compliance trends
Farmers can view suggestions and farm health reports

6. Multilingual, Accessible Interface
Voice-assisted navigation
Offline-first functionality
Low-data mode for weak network areas

7. Data Insights & Policy Support
Trends in disease spread
Region-wise compliance levels
Data-backed recommendations helping policymaking

## How the Solution Addresses the Problem
Converts complex biosecurity standards into easy digital tasks

Provides continuous monitoring instead of one-time inspections

Trains farmers through accessible content

Gives instant alerts to reduce outbreak impact

Improves transparency between farmers and authorities

Enables better decision-making using real-time data analytics

## Innovation and Uniqueness

AI-enhanced biosecurity scoring using farm activity patterns

Geo-fencing of farms for region-specific disease warnings

Gamified learning, awarding badges for completed modules

Offline-first mode for rural connectivity

Voice guidance for farmers who struggle with reading

Automatic compliance calendar, unique to each farm type

This provides a modern, practical, farmer-first approach.

## Technical Approach
## Frontend
Flutter / React Native for mobile

React.js for web dashboard

## Backend
FastAPI / Django REST Framework for API layer

## Database
PostgreSQL for structured data
Redis for caching alerts and notifications

## Cloud & Hosting
AWS EC2 / Lambda for backend

S3 for media content storage

Firebase Cloud Messaging for push alerts

## AI & Analytics
Python-based models for risk scoring and outbreak prediction

GIS tools for mapping biosecurity hotspots

## Development Methodology
Requirement gathering & field studies

UI/UX prototyping and farmer usability testing

Development of risk scoring and compliance modules

Integration of alert engine and multilingual interface

GIS mapping and analytics integration

Pilot testing with actual farms

Deployment + refinement based on feedback


## Feasibility and Viability

## Technical Feasibility
All technologies are mature and widely used

Easily scalable to multiple states

Mobile-first design ensures wide adoption

## Potential Challenges
Farmers may not be familiar with digital platforms

Network issues in interior rural regions

Hesitation to share data

## Strategies to Overcome Challenges
Voice-guided usage tutorials inside the app

Local data storage + sync when internet is available

Strong security (AES encryption, role-based access)


## Impact and Benefits

## Impact
Lower disease outbreaks in poultry and pig farms

Data-based surveillance for government departments

Higher productivity, lower mortality

Economic stability for small farmers

## Benefits
Social: Better awareness, strong collaboration

Economic: Prevents economic losses caused by diseases

Environmental: Better waste handling, reduced chemical overuse
